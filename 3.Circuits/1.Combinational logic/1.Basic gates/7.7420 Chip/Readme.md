# 7420 Chip Equivalent – Dual 4-input NAND Gate

## Overview
This Verilog module replicates the behavior of the **7420 TTL logic chip**, which contains **two independent 4-input NAND gates**. Each NAND gate outputs the negation of the logical AND of four inputs.

## Module Functionality

### top_module
- **Inputs:**
  - Group 1: `p1a`, `p1b`, `p1c`, `p1d` — 4 inputs to the first NAND gate.
  - Group 2: `p2a`, `p2b`, `p2c`, `p2d` — 4 inputs to the second NAND gate.
- **Outputs:**
  - `p1y` — Output of first 4-input NAND gate.
  - `p2y` — Output of second 4-input NAND gate.

## Logic Explanation

Each output is generated by a 4-input NAND gate:
- **NAND Logic**: The output is `1` unless **all inputs** are `1`, in which case it outputs `0`.
- **Expressions:**
  - `p1y = ~(p1a & p1b & p1c & p1d)`
  - `p2y = ~(p2a & p2b & p2c & p2d)`

This simple combinational circuit demonstrates how multi-input NAND logic can be instantiated using basic Verilog operations.

## Use Case

- Useful for logic gate simulation.
- Helps understand multi-input logic behavior.
- Can be extended for testing larger combinational modules or used as a building block in complex digital systems.
