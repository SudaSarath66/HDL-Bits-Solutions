# ðŸ”² Kmap1 â€“ Karnaugh Map Simplification Logic

## Overview
This module implements a combinational logic circuit derived from a Karnaugh Map (K-map). The logic is simplified using the Sum of Products (SOP) method to achieve minimal gate usage and optimal performance. The exercise emphasizes K-map simplification and its direct application to Verilog.

## Module Functionality
- **Inputs**:  
  - `a`: 1-bit input  
  - `b`: 1-bit input  
  - `c`: 1-bit input  
- **Output**:  
  - `out`: 1-bit output that results from evaluating the minimized Boolean expression from the K-map

## Use Case
Useful for designing efficient combinational logic circuits in hardware where optimization is important. This is often applied in digital electronics design courses, interviews, and FPGA logic minimization tasks.
