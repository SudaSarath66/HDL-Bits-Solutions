# AND Gate Module

## Overview
This Verilog module implements a basic 2-input AND gate using the bitwise AND operator (`&`). The output is high (`1`) only when both input signals are high.

## Module Functionality
- **Module Name:** `top_module`
- **Inputs:**  
  - `a`, `b` — 1-bit input signals  
- **Output:**  
  - `out = a & b` — logical AND of `a` and `b`

## Use Case
This is a foundational module used to teach binary operations and logic gate synthesis in digital design. Commonly featured in beginner Verilog tasks.
