# Constant Logic High Output Module

## Overview
This Verilog module implements a simple digital logic that continuously drives a high (`1`) signal on its output. It demonstrates the use of the `assign` statement to drive a constant value — a fundamental concept in hardware description languages.

## Module Functionality
- **Module Name:** `top_module`
- **Output:** `one` — always set to logic high (`1`)

## Use Case
This module is a basic building block for testing logic synthesis and is commonly used as a starting point for learning Verilog syntax and hardware behavior.
