# Constant Logic Low Output Module

## Overview
This Verilog module outputs a constant logic low (`0`) on its output. It is designed to demonstrate the use of the `assign` statement for driving fixed binary values — a key concept in structural and RTL design.

## Module Functionality
- **Module Name:** `top_module`
- **Output:** `zero` — always set to logic low (`0`)

## Use Case
This minimal module is typically used in early-stage Verilog exercises to reinforce basic syntax and continuous assignment. It is also suitable for HDLBits-style logic fundamentals.
